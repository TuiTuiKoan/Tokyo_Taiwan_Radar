## 2026-04-25 — Doorkeeper Tokyo filter false positive (中央区)

**Error:** `中央区` was included in `_TOKYO_MARKERS` in `doorkeeper.py`.
This matched 神戸市中央区, causing a Kobe event to pass the Tokyo location filter.

**Fix:** Removed all ward names that are not geographically unique to Tokyo from `_TOKYO_MARKERS`.
Kept only `東京都`, `東京`, and 23-ward names that are exclusive to Tokyo prefecture.

**Lesson:** Never add bare ward names like `中央区`, `南区`, `北区`, `西区` to a Tokyo marker set —
they appear in Osaka, Kobe, Nagoya, and many other cities.
The safest Tokyo markers are `東京都` and `東京` as substring matches.
Individual ward names are only safe if they are provably unique to Tokyo (e.g. `渋谷区`, `豊島区`).

## 2026-04-25 — Connpass API v1 → v2 migration (403 on v1)

**Observation:** Connpass API v1 (`/api/v1/event/`) now returns HTTP 403 for all requests,
including those from fixed IPs. The platform has fully migrated to v2 which requires an `X-API-Key` header.

**Implementation decision:** Built `ConnpassScraper` against v2 API.
If `CONNPASS_API_KEY` is not set, scraper logs a WARNING and returns `[]` — pipeline continues uninterrupted.

**Lesson:** API v1 is dead. Do not reference v1 endpoints in any future Connpass code.
The v2 key must be obtained via the Connpass help page: https://connpass.com/about/api/
Their ToS also explicitly prohibits non-API scraping (Playwright/curl), so the API key is mandatory.
