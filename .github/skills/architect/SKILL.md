# Architect Skills

Read this at the start of every session before producing any plan.

## Planning
- Always check whether a new feature requires a DB schema change. If yes, mark Step 1 as a manual migration with verification SQL.
- Identify all code paths affected by a data model change — not just the obvious one (a new column needs both the table AND every writer that populates it).
- Never ship a plan with an untested API or signature change. Include an explicit smoke-test step.
- Confirm that all pending migrations are applied before designing features that build on them.

## Scope
- State explicitly what is NOT in scope. Ambiguous scope = scope creep = breaking changes.
- List every affected file path explicitly — vague descriptions ("the scraper files") are not acceptable.

## After Identifying a Planning Mistake
1. Append an entry to `.github/skills/architect/history.md` (newest at top).
2. If the lesson generalizes, add a rule to this file.

## AI Model Selection
- Verify model capabilities before designing features requiring real-time data (web search, live prices, current events). `gpt-4o-mini` and `gpt-4o` have no web browsing. Use `gpt-4o-search-preview` or a real search API for current data.
- "Plausible-looking output" ≠ "real data access." A model without search access will hallucinate convincing-looking URLs.
